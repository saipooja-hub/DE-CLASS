DAY-4:

SQL Commands:
Drop: will drop entire data
Truncate : removes all rows quickly.
Delete: removes specific rows

#Querying language.

SELECT * FROM sakila.actor;

2.Distinct:it is used to check the unique values of that particular table.

SELECT DISTINCT first_name from sakila.actor;

# where condition :to filterout data and trying to check if there are any values are null

select * from sakila.film where original_language_id is null;

# count:
select count(*) from sakila.film ;

select * from sakila.film:

unique count and Distinct Count:

select count(first_name) from sakila.actor;
select count(distinct(first_name)) from sakila.actor;

limit:
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM sakila.actor limit 50;

optimization techiniques : when we have a huge volume of data we try to not query much on all the data.

#filtering with where clause:
SELECT distinct(rating) FROM sakila.film;
SELECT * FROM sakila.film WHERE length >= 92;

# SQL is nothing but data profiling or data analysis

#AND #OR Operator:

SELECT * FROM sakila.film 
where rating = 'PG' and rental_duration = 5
ORDER BY rental_rate ASC;
SQL is nothing but data profiling or data analysis
explained about AND , OR operator.

NOT Operator:
SELECT * FROM sakila.film 
where rental_duration NOT IN ( 6, 7,3)
ORDER BY rental_rate ASC;
WILD Cards in sql:
there are 2 wild cards used and they are percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
SELECT city FROM sakila.city where city like 'A%S'; #'A%s'

SELECT city FROM sakila.city where city like '__a__%';

#To know similar patterns

#NULL Value:
SELECT rental_id, inventory_id, customer_id, return_date
FROM sakila.rental
WHERE return_date  IS NULL;

#Group By and Having

select  customer_id, COUNT(*) as count_rentals
FROM sakila.rental
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING count(*) <= 30 
order by  count_rentals desc;

#Difference Between, where clause and having:

SELECT customer_id, sum(amount) as total_payment 
FROM sakila.payment
group by customer_id
having sum(amount) > 100 and customer_id between 1 and 100;
